/**
 * Each iteration is matched to another iteration, stack-style.
 * Whenever the 5th instruction of an iteration is `div z 1`, we 'push' the instruction into the stack.
 * Whenever the 5th instruction of an iteration is `div z 26`, we 'pop' from the stack and match the current iteration
 * with the popped iteration.
 *
 * Where am I seeing stacks? The values in the stack are encoded in base 26.
 * How to encode several values in a single number? That's what we do already with Base N numbers.
 *
 * For example, we can encode push(1), push(2), push(3) into a stack, and retrieve them pop()->3, pop()->2, pop()->1:
 * stack is a number
 * push(n) => stack = stack * BASE + n
 * pop() => n = mod stack BASE; stack = div stack BASE; return n
 *
 * For example, encoding [1, 2, 3] in base 10:
 * push(1) => stack = 0 * 10 + 1 => stack = 1
 * push(2) => stack = 1 * 10 + 2 => stack = 12
 * push(3) => stack = 12 * 10 + 3 => stack = 123
 * pop() => n = 123 % 10 = 3; stack = 123 / 10 = 12; return 3
 * pop() => n = 12 % 10 = 2; stack = 12 / 10 = 1; return 2
 * pop() => n = 1 % 10 = 1; stack = 1 / 10 = 0; return 1
 *
 * In this program, 'z' is the number that keeps the values in the stack.
 * For the model number to be accepted, 'z' must be zero at the end, which means no values can be left in the stack!!
 *
 * Now that we know which iterations match which iterations, how are they matched?
 * Each iteration tends to add stuff to the stack. The only exception is when an iteration has `div z 26` as its 5th
 * instruction, in which case it will not add to the stack. And, with luck, it will remove from the stack:
 * Lets call the iteration that was popped from the stack 'A' and the current iteration "B".
 *
 * For iteration B to not remove things from the stack without adding, the following condition must be satisfied:
 * -> A[n] denotes the nth instruction (zero-indexed)
 * -> A[n].args[i] denotes the ith argument of the nth instruction
 * A.w + A[15].args[1] + B[5].args[1] == B.w
 * This means that, when we "guess" a value for one iteration, it automatically lets us know the required value for the
 * other iteration. Further, it tells us immediately if the condition can be satisfied.
 *
 * Other way of looking at it, by checking what iterations do:
 * The result of the first iteration is push(w + iteration[15].args[1]). It adds the second argument of instruction 15
 * to the input value and pushes that value into z.
 * This is common to all iterations with `div z 1` (assuming their 5th instruction adds a number greater than 9 to x)`
 * If it doesn't add a number greater than 9, then I have no idea. You're out of luck.
 * If it is greater than 9, then after instruction 7 (eql x 0), x will always be 1, and will result in:
 * push(w + iteration[15].args[1])
 *
 * Iterations with `div z 26` pop from the stack and are able to avoid pushing things to the stack at the end. This is
 * accomplished by having y = 0 (last instruction), which happens by satisfying the above equation.
 *
 * Analyzing complexity: iterations only depend on each other in pairs, and each pair can have at most 9 valid values.
 * This means that we only need to check up to 63 combinations (NUM_ITERATIONS/2 * NUM_POSSIBILITIES_PER_DIGIT)
 * This is slightly better than the brute-force approach with 22876792454961 combinations.
